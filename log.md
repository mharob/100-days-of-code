# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code & Deliberate Practice. Furthermore, I made a sizeable chunk of headway in JavaScript during class time. At home I was able to complete the entirety of the HTML5 & CSS section within an hour and 25 minutes. 

**Thoughts:** I feel that due to my experience in C++ that adapting my knowledge of programming concepts to JavaScript has been a rather seamless transition. However, this is regarding the most basic of concepts of a language and differences have been noted. The most notable differences between C++ and JavaScript so far being the declaration of variables.  On the other hand, HTML was rather frustrating syntactically due to the chaotic but semi-organized nature of nesting multiple tags within one another. I found the use of classes within CSS to be a comfortable adaptation to HTML as I went along. 


### Day 1: May 2, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I fully completed the Responsive Design with Bootstrap and jQuery challenges in my 1 hour and 25 minute pomerro session. Furthermore, I utilized FCC's help system when I got stuck on a jQuery exercise and am grateful for the assistance.

**Thoughts** My frustrations with HTML from yesterday's session carried over until I became more familair with Bootstrap and jQuery. Once comfortable with it, I came to truly appreciate Bootstrap as a very powerful tool for responsively adapting HTML. In regards to jQuery,  I found its use of ids to alter elements  amusingly similar to how C++ ultilizes pointers to manipulate variables. However, that was easily outshined by how jQuery can "chain" functions together to achieve a desired effect. That was a particular new concept to me and I found myself curious about whether I could apply the same concept for use in C++ coding.


### Day 2: May 3, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the majority of the Basic JavaScripting challenges in my 1 hour and 25 minute session. However, that is frankly all I could manage as I had a rough time with the later material. 

**Thoughts** Today's frustrations consist of how objects work in JavaScript. While they may be similar to structures in appearance and design they can also act on entirely other behaviors. I was not sure if it was just simply the syntax or the logic behind utilizing the behaviors but a good portion of the object challenges through me for a loop. While I may of had setbacks and hardships today, I am by no means unmovtivated to charge in tomorrow and conquer these tests of adversity. My goal for tomorrow is to get through to the algorithim challenges and complete as many as possible.


### Day 3: May 4, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete all but the Profile Lookup challenge of the Basic JavaScript section. As well as complete the first and work on the second exercise of the Basic Algorithim Scripting section. All within my usual one hour and 25 minute coding session. 

**Thoughts** While I was able to work through the rest of the exercises for some reason I just can't get a handle on the profile loopup challenge. I believe it has something to do with establishing a if condition to check if the prop of the appropriate name is present. Usually to check for a property one would use the .hasOwnProperty function. However, how would one do so to check for the property for a specific name? Beyond that the reverse string algorithim was minimal beyond getting hung up on the behaviors of the seperator parameter for a time. The factorial challenge is giving me some grief in that my array will not populate and I will have to research further on the behavior.


### Day 4: May 5, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Basic Algorithim Scripting challenges up to Truncate a String except for Check for Palindromes in my usual 1 hour and 25 minute session. 

**Thoughts** I was finally able to fix my bugs within my Factorial Challenge code. The issue lie in that while my array is 0 based I was trying to factorial starting at 0 so I adjusted it to populate starting at 1. The rest of the challenges were not teeth-grinding except for the Palindromes challenge. I believe the issue has to do with my lack of understanding of the .replace property for strings. I tried reading up on it but it did not make any sense afterwards. Furthermore, I will have to spend some time to get a better grasp on regular expressions as I feel that will allow me to solve the problem more efficiently. Overall, I feel a great deal more accomplished than I did the previous day and am looking forward to tomorrow.


### Day 5: May 6, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Truncate a string, Slasher Flick, and Mutations Basic Algorithim Scripting Challeges during my usual 1 hour and 25 minute coding session. 

**Thoughts** Overall I did not have a great of issue working on today's coding challenges except for the tweaking of numbers. I was having a hard time coding for the right integers used to represent the position in which I would slice my strings or arrays. Thus I had set aside some to develop methods or algoritims in which to obtain the correct numbers if I was to find the solutions to the challenges. Unfortunately, I skipped the Chunky Monkey challenge for now as I wanted to complete as many challenges as I could and it was taking up my time. I believe my frustations with Chunky Monkey stem from the multi-dimensional arrays that lead to its solution. I will have to make considerable more analysis and work through the logic of the problem if I am to complete it. All in all, I feel accomplish and look forward to solving Chunky Monkey and the rest of the challenges.


### Day 6: May 7, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to solve the Falsy Bouncer and Seek and Destroy Algorithim challenges ontop of making headway on Where do I belong.

**Thoughts** In regards to my completed challenges, I found the solutions rather simple after some research. I felt they were helpful in providing an avenue to understand the mechanics behind the properties used to solve them. Beyond the scope of those challenges is the Where do I belong challenge which is causing me to have to consider the logic carefully. While I was almost complete it felt that with every change I would meet all but one challenge each time different. From my analysis of the issue I would infer that the problem lies with a lack of condition I need to check for in my if statements. I felt I have learned a great deal from today challenges I as stumble to solve the more difficult of challenges.
