# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code & Deliberate Practice. Furthermore, I made a sizeable chunk of headway in JavaScript during class time. At home I was able to complete the entirety of the HTML5 & CSS section within an hour and 25 minutes. 

**Thoughts:** I feel that due to my experience in C++ that adapting my knowledge of programming concepts to JavaScript has been a rather seamless transition. However, this is regarding the most basic of concepts of a language and differences have been noted. The most notable differences between C++ and JavaScript so far being the declaration of variables.  On the other hand, HTML was rather frustrating syntactically due to the chaotic but semi-organized nature of nesting multiple tags within one another. I found the use of classes within CSS to be a comfortable adaptation to HTML as I went along.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
