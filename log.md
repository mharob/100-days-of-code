# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code & Deliberate Practice. Furthermore, I made a sizeable chunk of headway in JavaScript during class time. At home I was able to complete the entirety of the HTML5 & CSS section within an hour and 25 minutes. 

**Thoughts:** I feel that due to my experience in C++ that adapting my knowledge of programming concepts to JavaScript has been a rather seamless transition. However, this is regarding the most basic of concepts of a language and differences have been noted. The most notable differences between C++ and JavaScript so far being the declaration of variables.  On the other hand, HTML was rather frustrating syntactically due to the chaotic but semi-organized nature of nesting multiple tags within one another. I found the use of classes within CSS to be a comfortable adaptation to HTML as I went along. 


### Day 1: May 2, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I fully completed the Responsive Design with Bootstrap and jQuery challenges in my 1 hour and 25 minute pomerro session. Furthermore, I utilized FCC's help system when I got stuck on a jQuery exercise and am grateful for the assistance.

**Thoughts** My frustrations with HTML from yesterday's session carried over until I became more familair with Bootstrap and jQuery. Once comfortable with it, I came to truly appreciate Bootstrap as a very powerful tool for responsively adapting HTML. In regards to jQuery,  I found its use of ids to alter elements  amusingly similar to how C++ ultilizes pointers to manipulate variables. However, that was easily outshined by how jQuery can "chain" functions together to achieve a desired effect. That was a particular new concept to me and I found myself curious about whether I could apply the same concept for use in C++ coding.
